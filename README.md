# ü©∫ MedTools ‚Äî Patient & Practice Management Platform

MedTools is a full-stack web application designed to streamline medical data management for clinics and healthcare providers. It provides a secure, intuitive interface for managing patient records, tracking practice performance, and supporting day-to-day clinical operations.

The system includes authenticated user access, role-based pages (Patient, Practice, and Profile views), and integrated backend services to store and retrieve medical data. Although some pages currently display mock data for layout and testing, full backend functionality is actively being developed and integrated.

# üöÄ Current Features

User Authentication ‚Äî Secure login flow with future password recovery and registration support.

Top Navigation Bar ‚Äî Global navigation for quick access to Patient, Practice, and Profile sections.

Patient Page ‚Äî Displays patient information (currently with sample data). Backend integration in progress.

Practice Page ‚Äî Will support analytics and data visualization for clinic operations.

Profile Page ‚Äî Allows users to view and update their account information.

Responsive UI ‚Äî Built with React components and clean modular CSS.

# üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Frontend: React, React Router, Jest (for testing)
Backend: Node.js, Express (integration in progress)
Database: MongoDB / MySQL (depending on backend setup)
Version Control: Git & GitHub
Project Management: Agile workflow with sprint reviews and code review guidelines

# üìÖ Development Status

Backend endpoints and data models are currently being connected.

One major page (e.g., Patient or Practice) will be fully functional by the next code review.

Dummy data is used in non-finalized sections for UI demonstration and testing.

Future sprints will focus on completing backend communication, validation, and deployment setup.

# üë• Team Roles

Frontend Developers: UI implementation, routing, and integration with API endpoints

Backend Developers: Building REST APIs and data persistence layers

Quality Assurance / Product Owner: Managing testing, documentation, and form uploads for code reviews

Mentor/Clinet : Gives feedback, and direction for project

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
